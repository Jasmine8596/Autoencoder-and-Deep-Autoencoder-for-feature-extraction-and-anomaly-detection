# Autoencoder-and-Deep-Autoencoder-for-feature-extraction-and-anomaly-detection

This repository contains the code for the following two applications:

1. Autoencoder and Deep Autoencoder for feature extraction
2. Autoencoder and Deep Autoencoder for anomaly detection by using reconstruction error as anomaly score
